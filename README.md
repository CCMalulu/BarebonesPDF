# BarebonesPDF
A VERY cut and dry PDF reader. No frills, no fluff.

Note that this is basically just a front end to Adobe's Reader but without all the extra crap. You must have Adobe installed in order to use.
Extremely cut and dry: one button to load PDF, that's it. I got sick of all the additional features that take unnecessary resources.
